# graph-vuls-findings

This is a local/unmanaged integration that scans vulnerability reports from
[Vuls.io](https://vuls.io) scans and ingests the findings into JupiterOne (J1).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* J1 Account
* J1 API Key
* Vuls installed and the ability to run `vuls scan`

### Installing

Export the following environment variables (or store locally in a `.env` file):

```bash
export J1_ACCESS_TOKEN=<api_key>
export J1_ACCOUNT=<account_id>
```

`J1_ACCOUNT` should be your JupiterOne `accountId`, which can be found by
running the query `Find Account as a return a.accountId` in the JupiterOne web
console.

`J1_ACCESS_TOKEN` is a JupiterOne API key, which can be created in the
JupiterOne console by going to the gear icon in the top-right, then clicking
`Users & Access`, then click the key icon and create an API key.

Then run:

1. `yarn install`

1. `vuls scan`

1. `vuls report -format-json`

1. Find the artifact json file(s) created by Vuls. These are typically in a folder labeled `/results/current/`

1. Within the `/results/current/` directory, run `cat {filename}.json | node ~/{yourClonedDirectory}/j1-ingest.js`

1. The newly created entities are of class `Finding` and can be found through the query `Find vuls_finding`.

The entity has the following properties:

* cve (CVE identity)
* serverName (distribution)
* platform (cloud platform)
* instanceId (server id within cloud platform)
* affectedPackages (packages on OS that are affected)
* displayName (name of entity)
* release (version of OS)
* family (Linux family)
* cvss (highest cvss3 score(or cvss2 if cvss3 isn't available) returned for the CVE from all vulnerability databases Vuls uses)
* cvss2
* cvss3
* severity (low, medium, high, or critical)
* numericSeverity
* summary (summary of vulnerability)
* createdOn (timestamp)

## Tests

We have included two sample Vuls json reports that were generated using the
`vuls report -format-json` command. Feel free to use these to test the ingest
process on a J1 test account by running `cat test/awslinux.json | node
j1-ingest.js`
